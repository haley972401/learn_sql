select *
from employee e1
where salary = (select max(salary)

select d.name as Department, e1.name as Employee, e1.salary as Salary
from Employee e1
join (
  select departmentId, max(salary) as max_sal
  from Employee e2
  group by departmentId 
) e2
join Department d on d.id = e2.departmentId
on e1.departmentId = e2.departmentId and e1.salary = e2.max_sal
